**Project Abstract**
In indoor environments like museums or galleries, traditional navigation methods such as GPS
and static maps fail to provide accurate and engaging location-based assistance.Visitors often struggle
to locate relevant information about exhibits in real time, leading to a fragmented and less immersive
experience.With the introduction of Artlistener,When a visitor requests information, their current
position is identified and the relevant exhibit description is delivered through audio. It enables visitors
to receive spoken information about nearby exhibits without relying on maps or GPS. The system
determines a user’s location based on surrounding signals and matches it to pre-recorded exhibit spots. To ensure accuracy, the system only responds when it is confident about the user’s proximity to a
known exhibit, otherwise prompting them to move closer. This creates a seamless, hands-free, and
engaging experience for users exploring indoor spaces.
